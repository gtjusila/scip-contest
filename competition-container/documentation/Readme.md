# SCIP Auto Tuner Contest Container Guide

### Welcome to the SCIP Auto Tuner Contest!
This guide will help you
‚úÖ Setup your development environment
‚úÖ Creating a solution that comply with our submission criterion
‚úÖ Doing a mock evaluation using the evaluation script
If you are new to docker and SCIP, don't worry! We will help you get started!

## Installing Docker

If you haven't installed docker you can find the official **Docker Desktop** installation guide using the following links

- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)

After installing open the terminal and check 
`docker --version`
You should see something like 
`Docker version 28.1.1, build 4eba377`

Optionally, to help with development, we suggest you to utilize your IDE support to develop inside a container
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/connect-to-devcontainer.html)
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/connect-to-devcontainer.html#dev_container_scenarios)

## First Time Run

We are now ready to run the container for the first time. To run the container type in the terminal
`docker pull scipcontest/autotuner-contest:0.1`
followed by 
`docker run -it --rm scipcontest/autotuner-contest:0.1`
You are now inside the container!


## Mounting Your Code
Inside the container, the folder `/mnt/user-code/` have been setup. You can mount a folder on your computer to the folder. **To mount a folder** means to make a folder on your computer appear inside the container at `/mnt/user-code/`. This lets the container access, use, and synchronize your files, so any changes you make are reflected in both places. Start by creating a local folder. For example,  we assume this is `/usr/scip/mycode`. 
Then, you can start the container and mount this folder by running:

    docker run -it --rm \
      -v /usr/scip/mycode:/mnt/user-code \
      scipcontest/autotuner-contest:0.1
You will be logged in to the container, inside /mnt/user-code you should see your code

## Creating A Solution
Inside the container, you can run the submission script by typing `evaluate testinstance.mps`. Test cases have been provided to you under the folder `/data/testcases` inside the container


## Tooling

The container comes pre-installed with the following tools and libraries. This will be the tooling available at the test system if any tool needed to **run** your code is not listed here please contact the competition organization team.
